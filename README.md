In this project I implemented the required sequence using independent module and then using them all together in one module structurally.
I provided the starting address in the test bench to be able to change it easily for testing purposes. and then wait for a ceratian amount of time units to let the simulation run for a bit.
In general the the trasmitter checks for the necessary conditions to send the data and the receiver checks for the parity for the data not to be corrupted.
