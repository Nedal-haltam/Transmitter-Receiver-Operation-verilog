In this project i did implement the sequenct using independent module and then using them all in once in one module structurally.
I provided the starting address in the test bench to be able to change it easily for testing purposes.
In general the the trasmitter checks for the necessary conditions to send the data and the receiver checks for the parity for the data not to be corrupted.
